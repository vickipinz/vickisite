various things you might find useful

## Software
Cool software that doesn't make you sign up for more fucking websites

### Cross-platform
* [JSPaint](https://jspaint.app/) - Web-based MSPaint clone. Add it to your homescreen and draw with a stylus, even.
* [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) - Offline password manager. If you want something in the cloud, use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).
* [LocalSend](https://localsend.org/) - Quickly send files over local network, including iOS and Linux. Like AirDrop but not shit.
* [Nicotine+](https://nicotine-plus.org/) - Alternative [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/news/) client.
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - Note-taking but with wiki-like links between notes. All markdown files, no signup.
* [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) - Web-based Photoshop clone, can even open/save PSDs.
* [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) - Sync directories between devices, good for stuff like pictures folder, password database, or Obsidian notes.

### Windows
* [File Converter](https://github.com/Tichau/FileConverter/releases) - Right click file converter, fast and no-bullshit. ([example gif](https://github.com/Tichau/FileConverter/tree/03aeec001e0ceef17a546ac5769122f06a8ac601?tab=readme-ov-file#description)).
* [paint.net](https://getpaint.net/) - Classic Paint-like editor with layers, many useful tools, and even more with [plugins](https://www.boltbait.com/pdn/). Great for making quick edits when you don't want to wait 20 seconds for Photoshop to open
* [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) - Screenshot tool.
* [StartAllBack](https://www.startallback.com/) - Windows 11 UI upgrade, the sequel to [StartIsBack](https://www.startisback.com/). It's $5, but absolutely worth it since it's both visually tasteful and doesn't fuck up your install like other Windows customization tools.

### Firefox extensions
* [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) - Stop using multiple adblockers and weird shady privacy plugins/browsers that break sites and often just send your info elsewhere. Just use uBlock Origin and add custom filters when needed.
* [Speed-Pitch changer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/speed-pitch-changer/) - Nightcore any video/audio. (tip: only do semitones; do +5 or +7 for music)

### Linux
* [Distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) - Install packages in containers and save your host from dependency hell and dated packages. Surprisingly seamless and a must-have for immutable distros.
* [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tlrc) - Command that shows brief cheatsheets for many commands.
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - Like i3 but for people who actually get work done lol
